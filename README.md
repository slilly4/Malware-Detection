# Detection of Malware Based on Android App Permissions 

This project endeavors to apply machine learning algorithms to a dataset of Android app security permission settings to determine whether a given app is malware or not.  Since providing labels for supervised learning techniques can be time consuming and difficult, I would like to determine whether unsupervised methods can provide comparable results to the Supervised ones.  If so, unsupervised learning methods could greatly increase the ease by which apps are classified and flagged.

This binary classification problem is important because there are hundreds of thousands of apps available for download through the Android app store.  There needs to be a quick and easy way to make sure that a given app is safe for download.  Security permissions can be a warning that a given app is Malware.  Malware creators often request more permissions than would normally be necessary for a legitimate app.  If we can identify malicious apps, then we can save Android users from harm.  

For the purposes of this project the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and K-Means algorithms will be employed as Unsupervised learning methods, and Singular Value Decomposition, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting algorithms will be used as Supervised learning methods.  All of these will be compared for accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Scores.  Select methods will also be evaluated using the Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and AUC.
